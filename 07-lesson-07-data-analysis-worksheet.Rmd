## Lesson 

This lesson will be a guided practical applying all the principles learned over the course.

You may have some of your own data that you would like to analyse, using this worksheet as a guide. Alternatively you can use the datasets we have been interacting with during the course.

- An [RCT]({{page.dataurl_2%}}) comparing post-operative pain control after axillary node dissection with local anaesthetic infiltration via the drain versus injection to the skin flaps (Thanks to Muska Khpal)
- [SPOTlight study data]({{page.dataurl_1 %}}): an observational study of deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care

### Step 1: Load in your own data

Depending on the form your data takes, use `read.csv()`, `read.table()` or `readxl::read_excel()` to bring your data in to `R`, and assign it to an object name.

```
# For example
dataframe.name <- read.csv("file/path.csv", ...)

# If using an .xlsx file
library(readxl)
dataframe.name <- read_excel("file/path.xlsx", ...)
```

<a name="examine"></a>

### Step 2: Examine your data in general

You want some idea of what your data looks like, so you can have a feel of what you have to play with. Try answering the following questions about your own dataset to make sure you understand it:

- Did the dataset load correctly into R? Remember sometimes there are weird column names
- Do you have a lot of empty cells that got loaded at the bottom of the dataframe which are actually useless?
- Do you know how many observations your dataset has or should have?
- What variables do you have in your dataset?

```
# Try using some of the following commands
View(dataframe.name)
head(dataframe.name)
tail(dataframe.name)
summary(dataframe.name)
nrow(dataframe.name)
str(dataframe.name)
names(iris)

# Try using this function from the Hmisc package
# You might need to first install the package
# install.packages("Hmisc")
library(Hmisc)
describe(dataframe.name)
```
