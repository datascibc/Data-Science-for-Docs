Outline of course

Describe some of the tasks in Excel

- group and summarise data
- produce a plot by group
- run an analysis, then make a change to a data point and re-run the analysis with the touch of a button


From data, to output

What you will be able to do at the end

We want to excite you
Show you some things that are slightly hard, but enough that is easy that you can do much by yourself

- work reproducibly
    + text files!
- manipulate data 
- produce amazing plots
    - ggplot
    - plotly
- not be afraid of statistics
    + be prepared to plot, look and comment
    + not be enslaved to 'p'
    + see Fig 1.1 McElreath 
- collaborate effectively
    - google docs
    - git


Other resources

- justify the command line and text files
    + reproducible research
    + speed (eventually)
- justify the lack of output from R
    + you need to _decide_ what is important and ask for it; if you don't know then you shouldn't look
